Ruex is a Centralized State Management And Design Patterns for Rust.

**Angular Rust** is a high productivity, `platform-agnostic` frontend framework for the [Rust language](https://www.rust-lang.org/). It now supports desktop and web development. Angular Rust currently uses GTK for desktop development and WebAssembly for web development. We are planning to add support for mobile development.
