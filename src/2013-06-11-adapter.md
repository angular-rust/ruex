Also Known As: **Wrapper**

## Definition

Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect.
Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of
incompatible interfaces.

## Problem

Often systems of code need to interact. If this is designed from the start then
there is no problem. One system defines an abstraction and the other system
adds implementation for that interface.

The problem arises when the system that uses the abstraction changes its
requirements. If the implementation changes, then the interface is now broken.

## Wrong Solution

One way to fix this is to just rewrite the system the interface to still match
the new implementation. This is *can* work in some cases but depending on the
size of the system it might not be feasible.

## Correct Solution

The correct solution using the Adapter pattern would be to just make a middle
layer that **adapts** the interface the first system expects into the new
implementation.

This mitigates the need to rewrite both systems yet allows flexibility in case
systems continue to change.

## Example

Back in the 60s there were tons of Astronatus working for NASA. At the
time, all they needed to learn was how to fly NASA's ships. When ever NASA
came out with a new ship, it was similar to the olds ones. This worked for
decades. All was well in the galaxy.

However in 2010, NASA shut down the Space Shuttle program. The Astronauts
were out of jobs and started to look for new ones. Once the Astronauts realized
that their space suits made for poor work attire on Earth, they knew they had to
revisit the stars. So they went to the next best company to work for, SpaceX.
When they got to SpaceX they realized that technology had changed quite a bit
since the 60s. SpaceX realized this as well, so to compensate for the Astronauts
they came up with an idea to use the Adapter pattern.

The smart SpaceX engineers made a new class that just 'Adapted' the old
interface of the NASA Space Shuttles to SpaceX's new rocket ships. The
Astronauts now had no problem flying SpaceX's ships through the galaxy.

Together the Astronauts and SpaceX were able to settle the galaxy far
and wide.
